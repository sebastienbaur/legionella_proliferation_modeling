Modeling of the proliferation of Legionella Pneumophila in industrial cooling systems

This repository contains code to solve a coupled PDE system written in SCILAB. This system describes the evolution of the quantity of Legionella 
Pneumophila in a 1d setting (in a biofilm, along a wall), modelled as a continuous quantity.
The modeling choice are described in the folder "modelisation mathematique", and the numerical solving in the folder "resolution numerique"

This work was accomplished while at Ecole Centrale Paris, in collaboration with a few other students. I focused on both theoretical and
numerical aspects.
